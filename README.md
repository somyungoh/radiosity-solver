# radiosity-solver
A very basic radiosity solver, implementation of a paper'A Progressive Refinement Approach to Fast Radiosity Image Generation'(Cohen, 1988)

This project is a coursework of Computer Graphics(CSCE 641), Texas A&M University.

The techniques include:
- Compute patch to element formfactor using Hemicube
- Solve radiosity equation by progressive refinement
- Compute ambient term
